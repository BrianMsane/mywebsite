    Brian is smart, passionate, and hardworking boy doing BSc in IT at UNESWA. I started recognizinig him in my classes
    during his first year as he could always standout. he also caught my attention when he was tirelessly working on a 
    hackathon in 2022 - his efforts surpassed my expectation given that he was still in first year. From then I took him under my 
    mentorship and he has already attended one of the prestigious conference in AI which is IJCAI. with my supervision, he
    made a study on the applications of tree-based algorithms for financial inclusion in africa and he was selected to present
    that study in the conference. in addition to that, he has done so many project while learning machine learning, naturual language process,
    computer vision, and explainable AI.

    During his internship at eTihuku Technologies, Brian really showcased his skills and ability to learn new skills and concepts within a short period of time. All the tasks allocated to him were accomplished within the given time and if he had challenges, he would consult his manager and the other members of the Data Team to seek for solutions. What could stick out to me is the hunger for knowledge and the incredible rate of knowledge absorption which led to the success of his first ever professional internship. It is the culture of our company to knowledge sharing sessions and he beautifully delivered two well-researched presentations during this internship. I can safely say that in a few years, he will be one of the best data scientists.

    I met Brian when he was assigned for my assistance in the Deep Learning Indaba Mentoring Program. At the time, he was planning to do research on sentiment analysis in Swahili and with the little time we had, we were able to start new project from scratch. I encouraged him to collect data on social media platforms, clean, annotate, and visualize it for his own language, siSwati. He came back with a report in just a few weeks time and I guided him, together with his colleague, to experiment different machine and deep learning models. Thereafter we worked collaboratively on writing a paper title "siSwatiSent: Sentiment Analysis Dataset for siSwati". Overall, he is a hard worker and has a desire for learning new things.

    - I had the pleasure of working with Brian during the formative stages of the Indaba X Eswatini UNESWA Chapter, where he served as the inaugural President. He played a key role in leading the club's initiatives to promote innovation and AI adoption within the university.  My subsequent collaboration with him and Professor Hatem on the "siSwatiSent: Sentiment Analysis Dataset for siSwati" paper highlighted Brian's significant contributions.  He demonstrated both strong technical abilities and a genuine interest in impactful work, specifically applying innovation to address real-world challenges.  His talent in web scraping and modeling, particularly his experience testing a variety of AI models for sentiment analysis, was invaluable to the project. He possesses a keen intellectual capacity and a proactiveÂ attitude.
