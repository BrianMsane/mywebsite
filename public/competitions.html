      I have entered a lot of Artificial Intelligence competitions and the ones
      below are chosen because I excel on them and ended up among the top three.
      Other competitions include:

        Having looked at the intricaces of regression when I first begun my
        machine learning journery, I noticed that there are a bit of some
        concepts I missed and this competition helped me strengthen them. To my
        surprise, this competition was beyond only regression but the data had
        an feature of time series. Realizing that helped me win this competition
        because after so much trial and error, regression algorithms did o

        This was a great introduction to Natural Language Processing and I got
        to learn about the growing field of study which pertains to low-resource
        or under-represented languages, particulary in Africa. I learnt about
        the concepts of transformers and their advantage over recurrent neural
        networks like LSTM, Bi-LSTM.
